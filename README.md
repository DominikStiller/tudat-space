An introduction and guide to the tudat environment.

# Repositories

- **[[tudat]](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat) A C++ platform to perform astrodynamics and space research.**
> If the tudat-environment were Io, the most geolocially active object in the solar system, then tudat would be its iron constitued core. It comprises of a powerful set of C++ libraries aimed towards facilliating astrodynamics and space research. 

- **[[tudat-resources]](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-resources) A curated database of resources to perform astrodynamics and space research.** 

> There is a continuous demand to incorporate readily available and accessible resources for tudat, as well as allow for unique analyses that may be rare. For this purpose, all spice kernels, space weather data, gravity models (everything that can be classified as data outside of a header file) have been separated from tudat. The end goal is to eventually have the package retrieve resources on the fly, as requested, from the original source.
