Choosing a Development Environment
##################################

.. note::

    Your choice of development environment will differ greatly depending on your intended development purpose

    **PyCharm**

    * Brilliant for developing pure Python code.
    * Extensive number of plugins to improve experience.
    * For debugging **Python** code, it is superior.
    * Execution will go through an entire script, unless debug mode is used. Not always desirable with data-science and numerical analysis.

    **CLion**

    * Close to on-par with PyCharm, although PyCharm is still superior for pure Python projects.
    * If your workflow involves C++, even if just to browse source code, then CLion would be superior unless you decide to use both PyCharm and CLion.
    *

    **JupyterLab**
    *
