  As of Tudatpy version 0.7, a number of modifications have been made to how Tudatpy deals with vehicle orientations, in particular in the context of thrust and aerodynamic guidance. These changes are, in part, :ref:`not backwards compatible<backwards_incompatibility>`. The examples below dealing with thrust and aerodynamics are **not yet up-to-date**. This will be corrected by mid-October.
