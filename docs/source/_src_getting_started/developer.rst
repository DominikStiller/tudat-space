Getting Started as a Developer
==============================

To the legacy developers of Tudat and its ecosystem: I apologise sincerely.
The codebases have gone through a complete refractoring, but I will motivate
and go through each and every one of them. I also give you my word that I will
be here be here to ensure a smooth transition to the accepted changes of the
codebase (I will refractor specific changes if it is so desired by the
majority). There are changes to the development workflow and user workflow
which concern both performance and conventions. Also, for the first time in my
memory of the environment, we have versioning!
