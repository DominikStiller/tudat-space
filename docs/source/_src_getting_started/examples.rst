Examples
************************

There are several example applications available in `this repository`_, in the form of Python scripts.
At the top of each `.py` example file, the topic and goals of such example application are explained in detail.

In addition, to facilitate the understanding of tudat(py) code, a selection of the example applications are
illustrated in more detail in the pages linked below.

===================
Examples with PyGMO
===================

Below you can find general examples, explained in detail, about optimizing an astrodynamical problem simulated in
TudatPy through `Pygmo <https://esa.github.io/pygmo2/index.html>`_. If you have never used PyGMO before, please
consider reading our introductory guide: :ref:`Optimization with PyGMO`.

=========================================
Examples of MGA-DSM transfer trajectories
=========================================

Below you can find general examples, explained in detail, about using the tools (initially developed for the Concurrent
Design Lab (CDL)) available for analyzing Multiple Gravity Assist transfer trajectories with Deep Space Maneuvers (MGA-DSM).

.. warning::
    TODO: Check if the CDL/MGA-DSM tab still disappears from the TOC on the left sometimes (e.g. when clicking on Simulations
    with TudatPy)

.. warning::
    TODO: Is there some reference for the CDL? (Both CDL code and documentation)
