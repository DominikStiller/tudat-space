Tudat Space: Documentation
======================================

Tudat Space is a platform and community for astrodynamics and space research.
Our mission is to provide educators, researchers, students, and
enthusiasts access to a powerful toolkit, fuelling careers and
passions in astrodynamics and space.

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of libraries that support astrodynamics and space research.
One of the key strengths within Tudat is its ability to combine such libraries in a powerful simulator framework.
Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamic to interplanetary
missions. The functionality of Tudat is implemented in C++, but a Python interface, called Tudatpy, is now available,
through which the core simulation functionality can be accessed. Tudat and Tudatpy are disseminated as conda packages,
to get started on them, have a look at our
:ref:`installation guide<getting_started_tudatpy>`.

On this website, you will find a user guide for Tudat, which walks you through the manner in which to set up a
simulation, and start designing transfer orbits, propagating trajectories, analyzing uncertainties or estimating gravity
fields! A detailed function-by-function description of our software can be found on
our  `API website <https://tudatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
